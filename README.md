# Hi this is my first module
Add ZRAM and swap to your android. It works by change default ZRAM size and add swap, both size to 1/2 of RAM. So you'll add virtual memory as much as your RAM.

## Notes
  - Please delete /data/swap_file after you remove this module. Currently this function is not implemented yet.

## TODO
  - Add option for swap size
  - Add lmkd script
  - Check user storage
  - Option for swap size
