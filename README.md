# Hi this is my first module
Change ZRAM size and SWAP size, applying lmkd psi. Change SWAP size up to RAM size.

## What is lmkd
The Android low memory killer daemon (lmkd) process monitors the memory state of a running Android system and reacts to high memory pressure by killing the least essential processes to keep the system performing at acceptable levels. These module use latest technique called "PSI monitors" because the vmpressure signals (generated by the kernel for memory pressure detection and used by lmkd) often include numerous false positives, lmkd must perform filtering to determine if the memory is under real pressure. This results in unnecessary lmkd wakeups and the use of additional computational resources. Using PSI monitors results in more accurate memory pressure detection and minimizes filtering overhead.

## Features
  - lmkd tweaks for smoother experience.
  - open more apps, while also maintaining performance
  - may increase gaming performance by reducing pressure aspects, especially memory pressure
  - you could tweak the props on you own just edit /data/adb/modules/meZram/system.prop then restart. Be careful because this modify low level system function. Could break you system although it isn't permanent, just reinstall or remove this module if its happened.
  - change the size of your ZRAM to 50% of RAM.
  - change the size of your SWAP
  - adjusting SWAP size on your own. Up to the size of your RAM. Although i don't recommmend it for general user because it's more likely has no performance benefits. The default 50% is enough.
  - miui and stock rom with some "bad custom ROM" usually not support lmkd tweaks. You as well just give it a try. Maybe some tweaks will get applied.

## TODO
- Add AI? lol ðŸ˜¹. Seriously its's never better. While demands changing based on user, the tweaks itself become less efficient. Add AI that could adapt to user seems to be interesting idea. But I still so much to learn, anxiety and depression is the biggest obstacle of mine.

## DEBUG
- Tested on Redmi 10C RiceDroid 10.2 Gapps
- Realme 5 Android 10
