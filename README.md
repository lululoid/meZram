# Hi this is my first module
Change ZRAM size and SWAP size, applying lmkd psi. Change SWAP size up to RAM size.

## What is lmkd
The Android low memory killer daemon (lmkd) process monitors the memory state of a running Android system and reacts to high memory pressure by killing the least essential processes to keep the system performing at acceptable levels. These module use latest technique called "PSI monitors" because the vmpressure signals (generated by the kernel for memory pressure detection and used by lmkd) often include numerous false positives, lmkd must perform filtering to determine if the memory is under real pressure. This results in unnecessary lmkd wakeups and the use of additional computational resources. Using PSI monitors results in more accurate memory pressure detection and minimizes filtering overhead.

## Features
  - lmkd tweaks for smoother experience. Based on https://source.android.com/docs/core/perf/lmkd.
  - change the size of your ZRAM
  - change the size of your SWAP
  - adjusting SWAP size on your own. Up to the size of your RAM. Although i don't recommmend it for general user becaus it' more likely has no performance benefit. The default 50% is enough
